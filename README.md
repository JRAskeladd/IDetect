# IDetect
We will use Histogram of Oriented Gradient Descriptor (HOG) to build a human detection and counting system.

Before diving into the code, what is HOG?

HOG is a feature descriptor that is often used to extract features from image data. It is widely used in computer vision tasks for object detection. We can implement it easily using OpenCV.
